# The Tabloid Proof of Concept

This CLI is a proof of concept for a web app that will allow people save info about favorite blog posts, authors, and blogs.
Users can add tags to all of the above to easily categorize and search for desired topics.
Additionally, there is a section for journal entries, so the user can catalogue their thoughts.

To run this code:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Type `start TabloidCLI.sln` in the command line and hit enter to open Visual Studio.
3. Run the `.sql` file as a new query to create the database.
4. Press play in Visual Studio to open the app!
